Step to the Music is your Radio NOPE dance party, giving you an hour a week of beats, grooves, and random left turns. Offensively eclectic and hip-sway driven, SttM will play Whatever It Takes to get asses in motion: disco, techno, house, hip-hop, FWD-style dubstep, new wave, no-wave, R&B, indie dance-rock, ska, dub, and anything else thrown into a blender and thrown at your ears in a completely unpredictable continuous mix.

SttM also occasionally indulges in guest-DJ spots and two-hour specials, including: Randall Murphy's House Selection, The 2015 Halloween Extravaghoulza, The Episode VII Intergalactic Disco Warm-Up Mix, The 2016 Valentime Luvv Jamz Bath-Salts for your Libido Mix, and whatever comes next...
