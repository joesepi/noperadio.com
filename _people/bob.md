Bob is a mocker and a rod and a pockist and a roptimist... who cares? LET'S DANCE!

Bob used to play trombone with Washington, DC's noise-jazz-punk collective Gestures before leaving the blizzard-prone Mid-Atlantic for polar-vortex-plagued Chicago. He now makes weird dance music and horrifying mashups as Hilarity Ensues and plays bass in 3-4 theoretical bands that will have their first practices once they find drummers.
