Deb DJs in London clubs – Gypsy Music nights, women's evenings, World Music and as part of the Shout Collective (blues, soul, funk and global beats). For the last few years the Shout Collective have played in Italy at a festival near Florence. Her music tastes cover all parts of the planet – if it's got a great tune or a dancing beat, then it's on the playlist.
Now she's taking it to a new level with “Hit it and Split” - a show that won't allow you to predict what'll be played next. Enjoy!
